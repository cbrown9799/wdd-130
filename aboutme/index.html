    <h2>Welcome to My About Me Page!</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is Conner Brown, and I’m a Business Analytics major at BYU-Idaho. I’m currently in my second-to-last semester and look forward to graduating soon.</p>
    <p>I’m originally from Kennewick, Washington, and am the oldest of four siblings. I’ve been married to my wonderful wife, Madi, for over a year, and we met while attending BYU-Idaho.</p>
    <p>Some of my hobbies include snow skiing, attending concerts, working out, and playing sports. I also enjoy learning about web development, which I believe will be useful in my professional career in data visualization and analytics.</p>
    <p>One of my favorite scriptures is Proverbs 3:5–6: “Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.” This has been a guiding principle throughout my life and education.</p>
