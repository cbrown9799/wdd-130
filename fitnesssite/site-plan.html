          <li><strong>Split Training:</strong> Plans that focus on specific muscle groups each day for optimized muscle growth.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
          Each of our workout programs comes with detailed explanations, video tutorials, and 
          modifications based on fitness levels. Whether you prefer lifting weights, bodyweight

          For beginners, our introduction to strength training covers everything from basic movement

      <h3>Nutrition and Recovery</h3>
      <p>
          Achieving fitness goals is not just about working out – proper nutrition and recovery play a crucial role. This section provides in-depth meal planning guides, hydration strategies, and supplementation recommendations.
      </p>
      <ul>
          <li>Meal plans tailored for muscle gain, fat loss, and maintenance.</li>
          <li>Hydration and nutrient timing strategies to enhance performance.</li>
          <li>Post-workout recovery techniques, including foam rolling and stretching routines.</li>
          <li>Tips for optimizing sleep to maximize muscle growth and fat loss.</li>
          <li>Supplement recommendations for improved energy, muscle recovery, and fat loss.</li>
          <li>Balanced macronutrient strategies for optimal energy levels.</li>
          <li>Essential vitamins and minerals required for peak performance.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
          Proper nutrition fuels your workouts and helps you recover efficiently. We offer meal plans 
          designed to suit different dietary preferences, whether you follow a high-protein diet, 
          low-carb approach, or plant-based eating.
      </p>
      <p>
          In addition to meal planning, we provide insight into hydration strategies. Many fitness 
          enthusiasts underestimate the importance of water intake in optimizing performance and 
          recovery. Our hydration tips ensure that you stay energized and avoid common dehydration-related setbacks.
      </p>
      <p>
          Recovery is an essential aspect of training. If you don’t give your muscles time to rebuild, 
          your progress will stall. We offer evidence-based techniques to accelerate recovery, including 
          foam rolling, active stretching, and sleep optimization strategies.
      </p>
      <p>
          For those who want to take their performance to the next level, we also dive into the world of 
          supplementation. We provide unbiased recommendations on pre-workout formulas, 
          post-workout recovery drinks, and protein sources to help you get the most out of your efforts.
